## Intro

Logic programming languages adopt a declarative approach by prioritizing expressing relationships, constraints, and rules. The execution engages with a computer via an inference engine. This engine interprets logical statements, deducing solutions based on provided rules and facts. The process entails pattern matching, unification, backtracking and more to explore potential solutions. 
The language's interpreter or compiler parses high-level logic code, translating it into execution-ready internal representations. This transformation may involve optimizing logical statements for efficient processing by the inference engine.
The engine evaluates queries by seeking valid solutions per defined rules and constraints. It iterates through potential interpretations of the logic program, striving to meet user-specified conditions.

## The Set-Up

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aggelospaschos/family_managing.git`

For this project, you'll need to download [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) and run the `.pl` file there through the `File -> Consult` and navigate to the directory where you saved this repo 

Go through the code, see and familiarize yourself with the language with the help of comments.

Finally, in the SWI interface, type in the query `?- start.` and play around with the outputs.
